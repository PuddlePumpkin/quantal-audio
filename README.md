# Quantal Audio VCV Rack Plugins

This is a series of plugins for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

Currently this plugin pack includes the following plugins:

- *Master Mixer.* A 2-channel mixer with a mono/stereo switch. In mono mode,
  input channel 1 will be copied to channel two's output. This is useful if you
  want to copy a mono signal to route to modules that need stereo inputs (for
  example, L and R channels of Core Audio module).
- *Buffered Multiple.* Two 1x3 voltage copies. With switch in the middle it can
  turn into a 1x6 copier.
- *Unity Mix.* Sum and average signals from 3 inputs into 1 output. With switch
  in middle in can take 6 inputs two 2 outputs.
